# monerivas-Crowdbotics-Frontend-Engineering-Challenge
On this project I’m creating a list of songs of the musician Taylor Swift, consuming data from the iTunes API. Using HTML5, CSS3, JS, jQuery and Materialize.


PLAN for the Trial Project “TaylorSwiftList” 

I divided the work that needs to be done in two phases: Functionality and Layout.

Functionality phase.

| Project folders structure (assets, js, css, html)      |  10 min                |
| Basic structure of the index.html                      |  20 min                |
| Reading documentation from the API                     |  40 min                |

Layout phase.

| TASK                                                                |TIME ESTIMATE TO BE DONE        
| --------------------------------------------------------------------|:----------------------:| 
| Organize the components into the grid                               |  30 min                |
| Fix the components that need to be fixed (make them not scrollable) |  1 h                   |
| Fill the components with the data from the API                      |  1 h                   |
| RIncorporate the color palette                                      |  15 min                |
| Add the mouseover effect                                            |  15 min                |




The remaining hour will be used to solve any problems, and to deploy the site on github. 

QUESTIONS.

There are any restriction of the frameworks and libraries that we can use for the project?

The deploy of the demo can be done at the gh-pages on GitHub?

The content of “Other charts” section can be added from another source (like be written static on the html) or it needs to be from the iTunes API


Final Question.
Answer the question: is there anything else that is needed before this can be deployed to production?
Yes I think the responsive interface should be improved and tested on different devices. Also the images should be the definitive ones. And most important, finish the requirements of functionality.
